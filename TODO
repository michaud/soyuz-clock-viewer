Bug:
  ☐ when not connected and turn on device, the device is turned on but doesn't run, if then connect, clock doesn't run and when toggle device off the clock starts running
    ☐ when not connected, turn on should be possible but if then connect clock should start running 

Todo:
  ☐ Make operational
    ✔ use hit target to enable disable hilites @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ hide hit targets when show hilite is disabled @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ☐ add clicks for switches, nobs and running clock?
  
  ☐ Chronometer
    ✔ start(ed) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ stop(ped) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ reset(ed) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ start synchronises with clock tick @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ it shows the mode you've entered: shows stop, when click, goes to reset and resets the chrono: shows C @done(21-04-09 02:30)
      ✔ so more like started, stopped reseted @done(21-04-09 02:31)
      ✔ push in sets dial to less then half the current state, release (up) sets to new state @done(21-04-09 02:31)

  ☐ time adjust button
    ☐ press in
      ☐ but also turn to find the mode
        ☐ should we implement that?
    ☐ two directions
    ☐ alarm moves with time adjust only when turned backwards

      ☐ to what state does the time adjust button move? seems to go to Mission time adjust
