Bug:
  ✔ when not connected and turn on device, the device is turned on but doesn't run, if then connect, clock doesn't run and when toggle device off the clock starts running @done(21-04-19 19:59)
    ✔ when not connected, turn on should be possible but if then connect clock should start running @done(21-04-19 19:59)
  ✔ click on second hand advance toggles state but shouldn't when in clock time make explicit iso TOGGLE ? @done(21-04-25 18:18)
  ✔ connector is not completely connected when connected @done(21-04-27 13:21)
  ☐ click on second hand advance when outside round zero for the first time clock doesn't advance half a second
  ☐ should switch near_to_zero state when powerOn and clock running?


Todo:
  ☐ Make operational

    ✔ hide hit targets when show hilite is disabled @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ☐ add clicks for switches, nobs and running clock?

    ✔ it shows the mode you've entered: shows stop, when click, goes to reset and resets the chrono: shows C @done(21-04-09 02:30)
      ✔ so more like started, stopped reseted @done(21-04-09 02:31)

new questions

- when you adjust the clock time, with the clock time adjust knob or the advance half second button, does the mission time also get adjusted?
  - [temp] no, just ignore
- what happens when the half second advance button is pressed when the hours & minutes button is in the 'out' position / mission time adjust mode?

marcs answers

- can you adjust the clock, alarm, stopwatch, mission timer when the device is not connected?
  - Yes

-  can you advance the clock ticks/half seconds when the device is turned on and the clock is running?
  - Yes. It’s just a mechanical link that pulls down the advance electro-magnet. So the advance is a mechanical OR of the electrical input and the adjustment button input.

- can you reset the mission time when the device is turned on and the clock is running?
  - I have not tried, but I suspect yes. The reset is entirely mechanical.

- does the mission time / clock adjust hours minutes button have three states? adjust clock, adjust mission time and 'idle'? or just  adjust clock, adjust mission time?
  - It’s two and a half states. It adjusts the clock hours (both up and down) if it’s pressed down. To get out of that mode and release the adjust button, you need to manually press the ½ second advance button. When it’s released, it adjusts the mission time. But only forwards, independent of the direction that you turn the knob. But most of the time it’s disabled. It will only work if the seconds hand is pretty close to zero. In other words, it has three states, but the two last states (disabled/adjust mission time) is automatically controlled by the position of the seconds hand. I demonstrate that in the second video.

- if you push the advance clock half a second button to get out of 'clock adjust time' mode, does it go into mission time adjust mode? or in an 'idle' mode?
  - Correct, but then whether you end up  in idle or mission adjustment depends on where the seconds hand is, as explained above.-
