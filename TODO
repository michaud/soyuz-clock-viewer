Bug:
  ☐ when not connected and turn on device, the device is turned on but doesn't run, if then connect, clock doesn't run and when toggle device off the clock starts running
    ☐ when not connected, turn on should be possible but if then connect clock should start running 

Todo:
  ☐ Make operational
    ✔ use hit target to enable disable hilites @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ hide hit targets when show hilite is disabled @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ☐ add clicks for switches, nobs and running clock?
  
  ☐ Chronometer
    ✔ start(ed) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ stop(ped) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ reset(ed) @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ start synchronises with clock tick @done(21-04-09 02:30)
    ✔ it shows the mode you've entered: shows stop, when click, goes to reset and resets the chrono: shows C @done(21-04-09 02:30)
      ✔ so more like started, stopped reseted @done(21-04-09 02:31)
      ✔ push in sets dial to less then half the current state, release (up) sets to new state @done(21-04-09 02:31)
  
  ☐ Mission Totalizer
    ☐ reset
    ☐ turn off the device
    ☐ time adjust button
      ☐ pull out & seconds in 0 position
      ☐ when not in 0 pos turning button doesn't do anything but turn
      ☐ adjust minutes by turning
        ☐ always counts up when turning left or right 
  
  Alarm
  ☐ advance alarm
  ✔ alarm on - off @done(21-04-10 16:58)
  ✔ set alarm turns one direction: backwards @done(21-04-11 01:13)
  
  clock
  ✔ second advance @done(21-04-10 16:58)
    ✔ half second steps @done(21-04-10 16:58)
  
  ☐ time adjust button
    ☐ press in
      ☐ but also turn to find the mode
        ☐ should we implement that?
    ☐ two directions
    ☐ alarm moves with time adjust only when turned backwards
    ☐ get out of adjustment mode press on second advance
      ☐ to what state does the time adjust button move? seems to go to Mission time adjust

- can you adjust the clock, alarm, stopwatch, mission timer when the device is not connected?
  - Yes

-  can you advance the clock ticks/half seconds when the device is turned on and the clock is running?
  - Yes. It’s just a mechanical link that pulls down the advance electro-magnet. So the advance is a mechanical OR of the electrical input and the adjustment button input.

- can you reset the mission time when the device is turned on and the clock is running?
  - I have not tried, but I suspect yes. The reset is entirely mechanical.

- does the mission time / clock adjust hours minutes button have three states? adjust clock, adjust mission time and 'idle'? or just  adjust clock, adjust mission time?
  - It’s two and a half states. It adjusts the clock hours (both up and down) if it’s pressed down. To get out of that mode and release the adjust button, you need to manually press the ½ second advance button. When it’s released, it adjusts the mission time. But only forwards, independent of the direction that you turn the knob. But most of the time it’s disabled. It will only work if the seconds hand is pretty close to zero. In other words, it has three states, but the two last states (disabled/adjust mission time) is automatically controlled by the position of the seconds hand. I demonstrate that in the second video.

- if you push the advance clock half a second button to get out of 'clock adjust time' mode, does it go into mission time adjust mode? or in an 'idle' mode?
  - Correct, but then whether you end up  in idle or mission adjustment depends on where the seconds hand is, as explained above.-
